You have multiple options: You can either take the normal bus/train transport from Innsbruck Hbf or take the shuttle bus we will provide, but remember to sign up first via email, because there is a max of 50 ppl.

### Which kind of topics can I expect?
We moved from almost 100% web development topics in 2018 to a more generic engineering set of topics. You will find topics like: Functional programming, VueJS, Unity, OS, game development, Signature UI, UI library creation, full-stack-development, developer experience, user experience, GatsbyJS, building communities, React-Native, AI&ML, tech leadership, web services, deployment…

We will continue including topics, as soon as we get feedback from the community.
